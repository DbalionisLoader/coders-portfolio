<p>I embarked on my first full website project – a 600+ product automotive paint ecommerce website for a local business in Leeds. This project was designed using Adobe XD and implemented through the WordPress CMS. To handle the products, I integrated the Woocommerce plugin. For the visual appeal and functionality, I utilized Elementor and Crocoblocks WordPress plugins.</p>
<p>While I embraced this project with enthusiasm, I encountered numerous challenges. Navigating the expansive WordPress ecosystem of plugins was daunting, as I aimed to find the perfect solution for creating a custom ecommerce website. Themes, a page builder, and Crocoblocks were used to achieve custom functionality. Though these tools were mostly effective, they were lacking in certain aspects. For instance, they offered limited customization options for the basket overview and checkout pages. Consequently, I liberally infused custom CSS to align them with my design. I also sprinkled in additional tweaks to enhance mobile responsiveness. As for the checkout page, the client and I desired a distinct appearance. However, owing to my current knowledge constraints and time limitations, I was compelled to compromise with the tools at hand, ultimately delivering a functional and presentable checkout experience. I believe that crafting a bespoke plugin will be the pathway to elevating this aspect in the future.</p>
<p>Another hurdle emerged when Stripe paused payments due to concerns about spam and card checking. Swiftly delving into research, I learned about card checking and how to counteract it. I swiftly employed the trusty reCAPTCHA to rectify the issue. Presently, I would integrate honey pot form fields – two straightforward and effective solutions against card checking.</p>
<p>This endeavor also provided insights into the limitations of WordPress plugins, including their deficiency in customization features. Moreover, these plugins significantly decelerated website performance due to the surplus CSS and JavaScript they introduced. Consequently, optimizing the website proved to be as time-consuming as its development. I experimented with caching, JS delay, plugin file cleanup, and CSS optimization, although some strategies yielded success, combining multiple speed enhancement methods resulted in unintended website malfunctions. Regrettably, I failed to achieve the desired page loading speed. However, I'm intrigued by the prospect of revisiting this challenge in the future, purely driven by my curiosity.</p>
<p>In pursuit of the desired aesthetics, I integrated substantial custom CSS in instances where Elementor or Crocoblocks lacked toggles. Additionally, I incorporated a touch of PHP to seamlessly introduce a custom varied product picker on the product page. Remarkably, this implementation took merely 30 minutes from the client's request to my delivery.</p>
<p>Tech Stack:
Adobe XD, WordPress, Woocommerce, Elementor, Crocoblocks, HTML, CSS, and a touch of PHP.</p>
