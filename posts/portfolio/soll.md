shortDesc:  My first full website project â€“ a 600+ product automotive paint ecommerce website for a local business in Leeds. This project was designed using Adobe XD and implemented through the WordPress CMS. To handle the products, I integrated the Woocommerce plugin. For the visual appeal and functionality, I utilized Elementor and Crocoblocks WordPress plugins.
