---



<p>The goal of this project is to upgrade my client's existing soll.uk website to improve its performance, customisation options, and overall appeal to potential customers. This includes optimising the site for speed and search engines, refining product listings for better visibility, and incorporating features like customer reviews to boost engagement. Through these improvements, I aimed to boost customer traffic and conversion in the niche automotive paint supply market.</p>
