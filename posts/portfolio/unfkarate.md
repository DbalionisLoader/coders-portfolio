In close collaboration with the club's captain and coach, I gathered essential client requirements to influence the website's design and functionality. Utilising Figma, I drafted a responsive design that aligns with modern mobile-first principles, as reflected in the choice of an off-canvas sidebar menu. The development stack was strategically chosen: Bootstrap for responsive design, 11ty for efficient static site generation, and vanilla JavaScript for interactive elements. Version control was maintained using Git, with code repositories hosted on GitHub. Continuous integration and deployment were implemented via Netlify, ensuring streamlined updates and robust performance. This methodical and collaborative approach ensures the karate club website is both functional and representative of the club's core values.

## Features to add

As this project is still currently ongoing, several features are awaiting implementation. These include: Event API integration, 11ty templating for the information webpages, and image optimisation using the 11ty plugin to serve the correct size images on different devices. Basic SEO optimisation will be addressed, such as using the appropriate title, meta, and semantic HTML tags. The finishing touches will involve performance and accessibility improvements, and integrating Google Analytics to assess whether the website attracts more potential club members.
