A small but cool tip calculating application. It includes a Bootstrap form UI, integer-only input validation, and radio buttons to select the tip percentage. The tip-calculating function ensures the input is an integer (had issue with value returning as string), checks which radio button is selected to determine the tip value, and performs some very* complicated maths to calculate the tip.
