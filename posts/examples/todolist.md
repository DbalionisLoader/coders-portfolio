Every developer's dream app is the to-do list. It's a blend of HTML UI, a touch of CSS, and JS DOM manipulation to add new list items from user input and remove them with a click. The main challenge was determining how to attach a 'remove item' click listener to an already existing list item. I need to enhance the to-do list by connecting it to a database to persist the list. Alternatively, I could export it as JSON and fetch it, ensuring it still functions on CodePen. But the question arises: where do you store the JSON file?
