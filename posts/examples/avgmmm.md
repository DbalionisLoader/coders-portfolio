A calculator to compute three statistical averages: the mean, median, and mode. Implementing the mean was straightforward. The median posed a challenge, especially with an even number of integers, necessitating the computation of the average of the two central values. The mode, the most complex of the trio, demanded the management of multiple modes. This involved sorting the numbers, counters for both current and highest repetitions, and accommodating the potential for multiple or absent modes. And, for style, I added a form UI for users to input integers into the array.
